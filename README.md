- Studied retention for a 4-month period (November, December, January, February)
- Counted orders ordered by new users
- Compared new user order frequency vs old user order frequency
- Calculated gross and net average order value (AOV)
- Identified power users for all months by removing repeated order numbers and analyzing repeated user IDs
- Analyzed power to power users for the periods of November-December-January and December-January-February
